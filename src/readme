Most people in the UK and Germany consider Elon Musk’s efforts to influence their national politics unacceptable and believe 
the US tech magnate does not know much about either country or the issues they face, a poll has shown.
the survey, by YouGov, follows a spate of hostile statements by the billionaire owner of Tesla, SpaceX and the social media platform X
attacking the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and their respective governments.
the poll, of more than 2,200 people in each country, also found that majorities of 54% in both countries
thought it was “not important” for their governments to cultivate a good relationship with Musk, and about 50% thought he was best ignored.
